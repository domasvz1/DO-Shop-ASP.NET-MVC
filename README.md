# DO Shop-ASP.NET MVC
------------------------
Public releases, this website project has not reached the alpha version yet. I have decided to publish this and curretnly I am working on 0.3 release (admin panel). This file will be updated once in a while to let people know what is up with this project.

Initially, this was my University project at Vilnius University. Most of the projects done in the University goes by forgotten and dropped out. I have decided
to continue working on this one and improving my knowledge in some specific fields during the development process.
Since there's a lot of things that can be tweaked and changed, I want to update the scripts and the documentation before releasing.
This website project won't be put up to the market or sold. As of right now, you are able to download the project with fair use freely. UI design remade thoroughly learning from Winkel bootstrap examples. There might some Lithuanian expressions left since this was my university project.

In this project, I am using MVC(Model-Based View) architecture design patterns also I am working with .Net Visual Studio IDE.
An E-shop hosted on localhost and written with the following frameworks (all of those frameworks can be found in use in the project itself):
If by any chance you are working with this right now, you are free to learn the following from this:
    * Migrations 
    * Entity Framework
    * Unity Container
    * Bootstrap
    * Winkel Boostrap
    * jquery
    * Plain javascript
    * Razor
    * Ajax

    The project uses Web Layer architecture:
    -  Presentation layer
    -  Business layer
    -  DataAccess layer
    -  UnitTests (additional Layer)


Taken from the Microsoft documentation: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps

* Modern, scalable web apps with .NET and C#
Use .NET and C# to create websites based on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript that are secure, fast, and can scale to millions of users.

-------
*  Dynamically render HTML with Razor
Razor provides a simple, clean, and lightweight way to create dynamic web content using HTML and C#.

With Razor, you can use any HTML or C# feature. You get excellent editor support for both, including IntelliSense which provides auto-completion, real-time type and syntax checking, and more.

-------
* Seamless integration with the data in the project.
The popular Entity Framework (EF) data access library lets you interact with databases using strongly typed objects.

Most popular databases are supported, including SQLite, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2 and more, as well as non-relational stores such as MongoDB, Redis, and Azure Cosmos DB.


More documentation coming, (need to read it first and apply in the website)
Also, later in the future, I will add a section about Winkel bootstrap right here for more information.

## How to launch the project 

You might have some addons or something else regarding the project, so I'm leaving you with this "Setting up the project" guide. If you pull the master to your local repository and the following errors occur, you can fix them using these few steps: 

  - In the "Package Manager Console" (in the Visual Studio) update -> Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r
  - When you have opened the solution,  set the "Presentation" Layer as a Startup Project in the Visual Studio's Solution Settings.
  - (Optional) Also, you can add "SQL Server Object Explorer" in view. If it's missing, restart the project (by opening it in the explorer using Visual Studio).

This error may also occur
"No context type was found in the assembly"

In the Packahge Manager Console (Or if it changes in the future in something similar) change Default project to "DataAccess"

"Enable-Migrations" in the Package manager (if its installed do the following). Migrations sould be tested on new PC when starting the project for the first time: 
 * If there are problems with migrations "Add-Migration InitialCreate and update-database" 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What are Unit Tests?

Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. After 0.4 this project will have Unit tests to conver some areas of the EShop.

- From the release 0.4, Unit tests will be added and every new feature should be convered with tests in the Controller or Classes etc..

[What needs to be fixed]
--

* Web Layer Architecture diagram needs to be done for the first release at least;



* Responsive buttons in the UI
* Change the language from Lithuanian to English
* Adminas/Edit/16 (Photo modificfaction widnow, back button doesnt work or deosnt exist)


Some starting tasks:
- Make coding practises better used (in the code itself)
- Make a script where (when launching the program for the first time) the "Admin user" would be inserted into the system's database automatically [so that would not be needed to do manually by the programmer]



Main window should use a btter styling.
- When connecting to the system there should be a window displaying theis problem
( You are blocked in our system, let us know how could we help you_)


----
Hierarchy of the locked login
-> first blocked, 
   -> then email, 
      -> then password
      ---(catch all three exceptions somehow or display in that order).

- Ispect more how databasesare created wit Entity Framework/Migrations using DataAccess



[Upcoming features and ideas someday]
--
Upload pictures, display one as icon and then have an album(array of uploaded pictures) and display them in the item page.


Designing architecture
(upcoming feature)


[Harder tasks]
--
Connecting the login (through facebook, twitter google, maybe leave reviews) 


# Decided to start error log here and how I Dealt with these issues:

Issue: Error thrown The required anti-forgery form field __RequestVerificationToken is not present Error in user Registration
Fix: If you have [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute before your action (In HttpPost, you can't have them in HttpGet),
then you should also add @Html.AntiForgeryToken() in your form after "@using (Html.BeginForm)"
